# Reinforcement learning #

This is a collection of simple reinforcement learning projects for my course "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence".

## Tabular Q-learning ##

Implementation using numpy.

* Tabular Q-learning for frozen lake
* Tabular Q-learning for taxi (work in progress)

## Q-learning with shallow neural networks ##

Implementation using TensorFlow.

* Neural network Q-learning for cart pole (work in progress)
* Neural network Q-learning for mountain car (work in progress)
